# Example React App

This is a small application built with React and Typescript. After having worked on multiple example apps as part of the screening process for various clients and companies, I figured it would be better to quickly build something that covers the basics usually covered in their evaluations.

- Fetch data from an api.
- consume that data and display it in a list format.
- execute some event when the user interacts with the data (clicking, scrolling, etc).

## In addition

Because most of these kind of tests typically involve a single page, a few components, and one or two http requests, it's not always easy (or feasible) to cover more features of React and its supportive libraries. That's why I took two previous projects, formatted them so that their UIs would be similar, and then merged them together with routing and lazy loading.
